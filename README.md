# ElectronBreakOutBoard
The break out / riser board for the Electron provides a way to check the Electron Plus1 cartridge slot signals during developing and error tracing of (new) boards.

You may choose to mount the 44 pin header strip on either side of the board. Just notice that if you mount it at the keyboard side, then pin 1 is not really pin 1 any more!

To mount the edge connector slot, first bend the pins on both rows slightly until there is a gap of about 1.6 mm. Then push it over the top edge connector (near the header) and solder the pins on both sides. Thatâ€™s all.
